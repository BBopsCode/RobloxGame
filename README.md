# Overview

As a software engineer passionate about game development, I created this Roblox game to further my skills in scripting, game mechanics, and user interaction. This project helped me gain hands-on experience with Lua programming and exposed me to client-server interactions within the Roblox platform.

The game is inspired by the *Glass Bridge* mini-game from *Squid Game*. Players are presented with about 50 rows, each containing two glass panesâ€”one is safe, and the other will cause the player to fall. The correct panes are randomly chosen by the server at the start of each round and synced across all clients.

Players earn coins for every correct jump and receive a larger prize upon successfully reaching the end. Prizes include in-game perks like the ability to push other players, shout across the map, or earn bonus coins.

There are also several purchasable game passes, including a gravity coil, speed coil, magic carpet, and various weapons. Developer products (repeatable purchases) allow players to buy coins and temporary in-game advantages.

I built this game to fulfill a childhood dream of creating a fully scripted experience entirely on my own, instead of relying on pre-made assets or code.
